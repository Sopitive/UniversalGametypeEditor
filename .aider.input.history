+Analyze the files `UniversalGametypeEditor/mpvr.xml` and `UniversalGametypeEditor/BinaryParser.cs` to determine what needs to be fixed to properly parse a binary file using the given XML. The code mostly works, but has errors.

+analyze the file `UniversalGametypeEditor/BinaryParser.cs` and attempt to fix the code to be more efficent. The code can also throw some errors, but has the ability to read most of a binary file. It uses `UniversalGametypeEditor/mpvr.xml` to parse the binary file.

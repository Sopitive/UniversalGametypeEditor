GUI for copying and converting gametypes for use in hot reloading in MCC. Supports use of both MegaloEdit and Reach Variant Editor gametypes.



Getting Started:

  1. Set the directory using the file menu to the directory you wish to watch for file changes.
  2. Set the directory you wish to copy the output .mglo file to or select the game using the dropdown menu.
  3. Modify or create a gametype in the folder you specified in step 1. Once a file is changed you should see the output in the program window.
    a. You may also select an existing gametype (.bin or .mglo) from the watched folder to copy it into the copy folder.
  4. Hot reload the gametype in MCC by clicking "Hot Reload" in game and you can choose to either enter the name of the gametype or leave the box as-is (.mglo) and click OK.

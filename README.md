GUI for copying and converting gametypes for use in hot reloading in MCC. Supports use of both MegaloEdit and Reach Variant Editor gametypes.



Getting Started:

  1. Set the directory using the tools menu to the directory you wish to watch for file changes.
  2. Set the directory you wish to copy the output .mglo file to.
  3. Modify or create a gametype in the folder you specified to watch for changes. Once a file is changed you should see the output in the program window.
  4. Hot reload the gametype in MCC by clicking "Hot Reload" in game and you can choose to either enter the name of the gametype or leave the box as-is (.mglo) and click OK.
